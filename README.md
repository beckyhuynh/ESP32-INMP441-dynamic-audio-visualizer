# ESP32-INMP441-dynamic-audio-visualizer
## **FINAL DEMO LINKED NEAR THE END OF THIS README**
## PURPOSE:
- Music visualizer using esp32 and inmp441 mic that takes live music/ audio and displays it on ili9341 tft lcd screen, via a bar graph/ circular rotating display
- Inspired by music visualizers that can be found when you search up audios for certain songs. I wanted to make my own version using hardware.

## HARDWARE: (setup)
### 1. Main parts used: (all parts can be found on Amazon)
- ESP32
- ILLI9341 TFT LCD display
- INMP441 microphone (**make sure you solder the legs(pins) onto the circular main part before using, most mics come delivered without being soldered**)
- Wires

</p>

## SOFTWARE (setup):
- refer to attached source code

**To run this project, simply wire per hardware guide, download needed libraries, copy the code into ArduinoIDE, change the following lines and hit play on any songs or sounds you want :)**

### Libraries to download:
- arduinoFFT by Enrique
- TFT_eSPI by Bodmer
- follow set ups for esp32 board linked below if you haven't already

### Main lines that can be changed:
1. 58, depending on your testing environment, play around with values to filter out low noise that you dont want displayed 
2. 165, change to constrain max bar height (default is set at 90% of the screen's height)
3. 169-221, comment out the different showSpectrum functions depending on what display you want to show

## Important notices and final notes:
- This project works best with some kind of noise amplifier or LOUD music playing. I used my fender guitar amp to make the music more alive for the mic.
- The mic is not very sensitive with regular microphone or laptop speaker, the bars will spike very little.
- This might be due to the manufacturing of the mic, since it is not a professional recording mic, or could also be due to the root mean square method which better detects PEAKS in loud sounds.
